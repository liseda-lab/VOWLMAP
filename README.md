# VOWLMAP
We present VOWLMAP, an extension of WebVOWL framework for validation of ontology alignments. The main goal of this project is to improve user interaction for validation of ontology alignments, by providing an interactive visualization of an alignment between 2 ontologies and interaction techniques that allow the user to explore and validate this alignment.

# Data

The JSON files in the data folder contain alingments between ontologies from Anatomy and Conference tracks of OAEI 2020.
